Easiest Backend Setup -- JSON SERVER....

npm i -g json-server

Create a db.json file in the root of your project with the following content:

{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "Hello World", "content": "This is my first post" }
  ]
}
Then run the following command in your terminal:
json-server --watch db.json
This will start a JSON server that serves the data in db.json at http://localhost:3000/posts.

json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
You can also specify a different port if you want to avoid conflicts with other services. For example, to run the server on port 3001, you would use:
