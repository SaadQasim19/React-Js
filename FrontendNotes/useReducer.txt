useReducer is a React Hook that provides an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic in a more structured way.
Reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, then returns the new state.

import {useReducer} from 'react'

const[state , dispatch] = useReducer(reducerFunction , initialState);

reducerFunction: A function that decides how to update state based on an action.

function reducer(state , action){

}

initialState: Usually Object.
